# Melina Reborn Kernel for LG G6 modern AOSP ROMs

Based on LGE OpenSource H870 v30a Kernel ([commit cff8191](https://github.com/zefie/lge_g6_melina_kernel/tree/cff81912fd72dc07746be77663b6cba73ebd5938))

**Note**: I own the US997, therefore I cannot test any other releases made available,
only compile them and let you try them. Keep that in mind.

**Always retain a backup of your current kernel and system image**.

## Information

 * For use on modern AOSP ROMs (10, Pie may be unstable) 
 * Developer tested on HavocOS-v3.2 (Android 10)
 * Uses [osm0sis's AnyKernel3](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2670512) system

## Features:
 * Release builds have significantly reduced debugging messages/routines for slight performance & battery enhancements
 * No (or less, still testing) random reboots compared other V30A based kernels
 * Moduleless Kernel
 * Optimize compiler flags with better CPU optimizations
 * Updated AnyKernel to v3, now retains Magisk [zefie/recovery_zip_template](zefie/recovery_zip_template)
 * Previous security updates from past Melina Kernels and new security updates
 * Optimize for performance rather than size
 * Binary releases built with ubertc aarch64-linux-android-6.x
 * DriveDroid CD-ROM Emulation Support
 * zzmove and elementalx governors
 * Higher performance with lower battery usage
 * Various other improvements

## Features for Developers:
 * [zefie/scripts](zefie/scripts) build helper scripts
 * BE DAI Name Table (sound soc HAL) backported from msm 4.x
 * Moduleless Kernel, don't need to work about modules and paths
 * Most Melina Reborn tweaks are enabled via a custom Kconfig menu, so you can choose which features are enabled
 * Re-enable debug via 2 kernel config options (`CONFIG_MELINA_DEBUG_DISABLE=n` `CONFIG_MELINA_DEBUG_ENABLE=y`)
 * Kernel is ready to compile in-tree or out of tree with clang or gcc (the clang build currently has an issue that breaks Bluetooth)

## How to build:

 * [Prepare your toolchain](ubertc-guide.md)
 * Clone this git repository and enter the directory
 * Edit `.zefie/scripts/buildenv.sh`, and set `TOOLCHAIN`, `KERNEL_DEV` and `KERNEL_NAME` path for your local setup
 * To build, run (for example `h870`) `.zefie/scripts/build.sh setdevice h870 clean build`
 * To build all 6 kernels (3 devices, debug and non-debug), run `./zefie/scripts/build.sh release-build`
 * To build all 6 kernels with clang, run `./zefie/scripts/build.sh clang release-build`
 * To build all **12** kernels with (clang/nonclang debug/nondebug), run `./zefie/scripts/build.sh release-build clang release-build`

If all goes well, output will be in `build/out/`,
and you can also use `.zefie/scripts/sideload.sh` to automatically sideload the most recent zip to TWRP.
