	  Select this to have a fully verbose kernel, like LGE's stock.
	  Selecting this turns on full kernel debug support, and will trigger a warning when booting Android.
	  Select "Enhanced Debug Removal" to disable debug support, and remove the warning, but at the cost
	  of making it more difficult to debug.

	  This option will cause a warning from Android boot regarding a DEBUG kernel and "trace_printk".
	  The warning is harmless, but this may slightly reduce performance.
	  However, it will make it easier to diagnose any problems.

	  If unsure, say Y here while developing, then say N here when making a public release.

	  These options significantly reduce the amount of debug information processed and displayed by
	  the Qualcomm, Broadcom and LGE drivers, slightly improving performance.

	  Under this menu, you can enable and disable specific device driver debug.

	  This option is required to remove the "trace_printk" warning on Android boot.
	  This may slightly increase performance, but will make it harder to diagnose any problems.

	  If unsure, say N here while developing, then say Y here when making a public release.
