config MELINA_CPU_OPTIMIZE
        bool "Compiler CPU Optimizations"
	default y
	help
	  Enables CPU optimizations flags, depending on your compiler, if any, you wish to compile
	  the kernel with. Please note that some options are incompatible
	  with the clang compiler.

	  If unsure, select Y.

config MELINA_DRIVEDROID_CDROM
        boolean "DriveDroid CD-ROM Mass Storage Emulation"
        depends on !LGE_USB_G_AUTORUN
        depends on USB_G_ANDROID
        default y
        help
          Allows you to mount CD-ROM ISO images with DriveDroid.
          Without this, the image will try to mount as a USB Disk (flash drive).

config MELINA_BCMDHD_MONITOR_MODE
        boolean "WiFi Monitor Mode Support"
        depends on BCMDHD
        default y
        help
          Enables monitor mode in the BCM WiFi Drivers

	  If unsure, say Y.

config MELINA_PERFORMANCE_TWEAKS
	boolean "Enable Melina Kernel Performance Tweaks"
	select CPU_INPUT_BOOST
	select TCP_CONG_WESTWOOD
	default y
	help
	  This is just a helper variable that enables the following:
	  CPU_INPUT_BOOST and TCP_CONG_WESTWOOD


config MELINA_WARN_AS_ERR
	bool "Treat compile warnings as errors (-Werror)"
        default y
	help
	  Disabling this option will allow the kernel to compile with warnings, but is not advised.

	  If unsure, say y here.

menu "Melina-specific Kernel Debugging Options"

config MELINA_DEBUG_ENABLE
	bool "Enable Full Standard LGE Kernel Debug Info"
	depends on !MELINA_DEBUG_DISABLE
	default y
	select EMBEDDED
	select EXPERT
	select GENERIC_TRACER
	select EVENT_TRACING
	select DEBUG
	select DEBUG_INFO
	select DEBUG_KERNEL
	select MSM_RTB
	select INPUT_EVBUG
	help
	  Select this to have a fully verbose kernel, like LGE's stock.
	  Selecting this turns on full kernel debug support, and may trigger a NOTICE when booting Android.
	  Select "Enhanced Debug Removal" to disable debug support, and remove the warning, but at the cost
	  of making it more difficult to debug.

	  This option may cause a NOTICE in the kernel log during Android boot regarding 
          a DEBUG kernel and "trace_printk". The warning is harmless, but this may slightly
	  reduce performance.  However, it will make it easier to diagnose any problems.

	  If unsure, say Y here while developing, then say N here when making a public release.

menuconfig MELINA_DEBUG_DISABLE
	bool "Enable Melina Kernel Optimized Debug Removal"
        default n
	help
	  These options significantly reduce the amount of debug information processed and displayed by
	  the Qualcomm, Broadcom and LGE drivers, slightly improving performance.

	  Under this menu, you can enable and disable specific device driver debug.

	  This option is required to remove the "trace_printk" warning on Android boot.
	  This may slightly increase performance, but will make it harder to diagnose any problems.

	  If unsure, say N here while developing, then say Y here when making a public release.
